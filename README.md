This repo has only GET and POST methods for my REST API.
The project also includes dynamodb database and s3 static webpage which gets user input and a field to search ddb item,
however, I didn't include a link to that page due to costs of every read/write to a ddb table.
If you want more info about this project contact me via my email: uns2801@gmail.com
