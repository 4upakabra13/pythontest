1. What is __main__.py used for?

__main__.py can be included in python package and is usually used to give a programme an entry-point.When launching a programme 
directly from the command line, python will look for __main__.py first and execute code which it contains.
You can utilize this by, for example, getting a user input straight from the console.

5.How can you truly restrict access to a private method of a class in Python?

You can add double underscore in front of a method which will show that this method is for internal use only for a specific class. 
I don't know and didn't find a way to making a method truly "private", so I believe it cannot be done.

6.What Python feature would you use to add some functionalities to an existing function without interfering into its code?
