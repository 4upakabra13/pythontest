So i didn't specifically do what was asked in readme in the last task. I set up an API, wrote 2 lambda functions, I set up a static webpage with s3 that takes a user input and 
adds it to a Dynamodb table () and then there is a list of usr_ids in the bottom of a page(which I will modyfi to searching a specific user when I'll figure out how to do it).
My Get and Post methods, work great when i test them I just need to figure out how to connect user's input and dbd table.
